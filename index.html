            <h4><b>From today's featured article</b></h4>
                <p>The history of the penny of Great Britain and the United Kingdom
              from 1714 to 1901, the period in which the House of Hanover reigned,
              saw its transformation from a small silver coin to a larger bronze
              piece. All bear the portrait of the monarch on the obverse; copper
              and bronze pennies have a depiction of Britannia on the reverse.
              During most of the 18th century, the penny was a small silver coin
              rarely seen in circulation. Beginning in 1787, the chronic shortage
              of good money resulted in the wide circulation of private tokens,
              including ones valued at one penny. In 1797 Matthew Boulton gained
              a government contract and struck millions of pennies. The copper
              penny continued to be issued until 1860, when they were replaced
              by lighter bronze coins; the "Bun penny", named for the hairstyle
              of Queen Victoria on it, was issued from then until 1894. The final
              years of her reign saw the "Old head" pennies, coined from 1895 until
              her death in 1901.</p>
